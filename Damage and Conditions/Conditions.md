Many effects impose a condition, a temporary state that alters the recipient's capabilities. The following conditions are defined in the rules glossary:

[[Blinded]], [[Charmed]], [[Deafened]], [[Exhaustion]], [[Frightened]], [[Grappled]], [[Incapacitated]], [[Invisible]], [[Paralyzed]], [[Petrified]], [[Poisoned]], [[Prone]], [[Restrained]], [[Stunned]], [[Unconscious]]

The definition of a condition specifies what happens to its recipient while affected by it, and some conditions apply other conditions.
