# Gaining Spells
Before you can cast a spell, you must have the spell prepared in your mind or have access to the spell from a magic item, such as a Spell Scroll. Your features specify which spells you have access to, if any; whether you always have certain spells prepared; and whether you can change the list of spells you have prepared.

## Preparing Spells
If you have a list of level 1+ spells you prepare, your spellcasting feature specifies when you can change the list and the number of spells you can change, as summarized in the Spell Preparation by Class table.

| **Class** | **Changes When You** | Number of Spells |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Bard      | Gain a level         | One              |
| Cleric    | Finish a Long Rest   | Any              |
| Druid     | Finish a Long Rest   | Any              |
| Paladin   | Finish a Long Rest   | One              |
| Ranger    | Finish a Long Rest   | One              |
| Sorcerer  | Gain a level         | One              |
| Warlock   | Gain a level         | One              |
| Wizard    | Finish a Long Rest   | Any              |
Most spellcasting monsters don't change their lists of prepared spells, but the DM is free to alter them.

## Always-Prepared Spells
Certain features might give you a spell that you always have prepared. If you also have a list of prepared spells that you can change, a spell that you always have prepared doesn't count against the number of spells on that list.

>Casting in Armour
>	You must have training with any armour you are wearing to cast spells while wearing it. You are otherwise too hampered by the armour for spellcasting.

# Casting Spells
Each spell description has a series of entries that provide the details needed to cast the spell. The following sections explain each of those entries, which follow a spell's name.

## Spell Level
Every spell has a level from 0 to 9, which is indicated in a spell's description. A spell's level is an indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips-simple spells that can be cast almost by rote-are level 0. The rules for each spellcasting class say when its members gain access to spells of certain levels.

### Spell Slots
Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting. Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster's magical potential is represented. Each spellcasting class gives its members a limited number of spell slots of certain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wizard has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots. 

When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively "filling" a slot with the spell. Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a certain size-small for a level 1 slot and larger for a higher level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that's at least level 2. So when a level 5 Wizard casts Magic Missile, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of four level 1 slots and has three remaining. 

Finishing a Long Rest restores any expended spell slots.

### Casting without Slots
There are several ways to cast a spell without expending a spell slot:
**Cantrips.**
	A cantrip is a cast without a spell slot.
**Rituals.**
	Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it doesn't expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Ritual, a spellcaster must have it prepared.
**Special Abilities.**
	Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast specific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usually limited in another way, such as being able to cast the spell a limited number of times per day.
**Magic Items.**
	Spell Scrolls and some other magic items contain spells that can be cast without a spell slot. The description of such an item specifies how many times a spell can be cast from it.

### Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a Wizard casts Magic Missile using a level 2 slot, that Magic Missile is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into. Some spells, such as Magic Missile and Cure Wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.

## School of Magic
Each spell belongs to a school of magic. The schools are listed in the Schools are listed in the Schools of Magic. These categories help describe spells but have no rules of their own, although some other rule refer to them

| **School**    | **Typical Effects**                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Abjuration    | Prevents or reverses harmful effects                         |
| Conjuration   | Transport creatures or objects                               |
| Divination    | Reveals information                                          |
| Enchantment   | Influences minds                                             |
| Evocation     | Channels energy to create effects that are often destructive |
| Illusion      | Deceives the mind or sense                                   |
| Necromancy    | Manipulations life and death                                 |
| Transmutation | Transforms creature or objects                               |
## Class Spell Lists
If a spell is on a class's spell list, the class's name appears in parentheses after the spell's school of magic. Some feature add a spell to a character's spell list even if the character isn't a member of a class in the parentheses
## Casting Time
Most spells require the Magic action to cast, but some spells require a Bonus Action, a Reaction, or 1 minute or more. A spell's Casting Time entry specifies which of those is required.
### One Spell with a Spell Slot per Turn
On a turn, you can expend only one spell slot to cast a spell. This rule means you can't, for example, cast a spell with a spell slot using the Magic action and another one using a Bonus Action on the same turn.
### Reaction and Bonus Action Triggers
A spell that has a casting time of a Reaction is cast in response to a trigger that is defined in the spell's Casting Time entry. Some spells that have a casting time of a Bonus Action are also cast in response to a trigger defined in the spell. 
### Longer Casting Times
Certain spells, including a spell cast as a Ritual, require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. While you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 minute or more, you must take the Magic action on each of your turns, and you must maintain Concentration (see the rules glossary) while you do so. If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. To cast the spell again, you must start over.

## Range
A spell's range indicates how far from the spell-caster the spell's effect can originate, and the spell's description specifies which part of the effect is limited by the range.

A range usually takes one of the following forms:
- **Distance.** The range is expressed in feet.
- **Touch.** The spell's effect originates on something the spellcaster must touch, as defined in the spell.
- **Self.** The spell is cast on the spellcaster or emanates from them, as specified in the spell. If a spell has movable effects, they aren't restricted by its range unless the spell's description says otherwise.
