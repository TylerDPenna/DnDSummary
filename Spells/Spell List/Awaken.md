**Spell Description**: 
	You spend the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, and then touch the target. The target must be either a Beast or Plant creature with an Intelligence of 5 or less or a natural plant that isn't a creature. The target gains an Intelligence of 1O and the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a natural plant, it becomes a [[Plant creature]] and gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. The DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened Plant, such as the statistics for the [[Awakened Shrub]] or [[Awakened Tree]] in the Monster Manual.
	The awakened target has the [[Charmed]] condition for 3O days or until you or your allies deal damage to it. When that condition ends, the awakened creature chooses its attitude toward you.

**Spell Cost**: an agate worth 1000+ GP, which the spell consumes
