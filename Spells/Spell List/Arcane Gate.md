	You create linked teleportation portals. Choose two Large, unoccupied spaces on the ground that you can see, one space within range and the other one within 1O feet of you. A circular portal opens in each of those spaces and remains for the duration.
	The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist that blocks sight. They hover inches from the ground and are perpendicular to it. A portal is open on only one side (you choose which). Anything entering the open side of a portal exits from the  open side of the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other. As a Bonus Action, you can change the facing of the open sides.
